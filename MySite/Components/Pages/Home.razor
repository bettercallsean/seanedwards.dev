            Hi, my name is Sean and I'm a full-stack .NET developer, working at Redrow on their internal WPF apps.
            I'm also a fond user of Python and enjoy making scripts with it to make my life less painful.
            I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2020 and started at Redrow as a developer in May 2021.
            You can find my GitHub and various other social platforms above!
